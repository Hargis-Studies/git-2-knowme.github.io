  <h2> Where you'd find me in the Flesh </h2>
  <p>  Running, fishing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, playing with math, playing the piano, thinking for incredibly long amounts of time, and reading classic literature. </p>
  <p> My current interests/hobbies outside of my work are geography, OSINT and cyber security, playing the erhu, and fighting through old pokemon games. I am also a self proclaimed Bob Ross.  </p>
